No offensive, hurtful, discriminatory, or profane language in the chats or in nicknames. No references to real-world politics or religion.",
      "Be positive & supportive. Keep the conversation on topic and don't criticize people. Avoid accusatory language, or being overtly argumentative. Deliberate baiting or trolling will not be tolerated.",
      "Keep public channels PG-13. Some leeway is acceptable during games and in private chats, but only if everybody present is comfortable with it (i.e. always ask before). In any case, we never tolerate any form of NSFW (obscenity/nudity/sex/gore/disturbing) discussion or material.",
      "Abide by the discord rules and any applicable legislation in your country. Importantly, we do not tolerate piracy of game materials.",

      "If a DM asks for any information prior to a session this must be submitted 24 hours in advance, or longer if specified by the DM.  Players must also give a minimum of 2 hours notice to the DM in the event that they are unable to attend, to enable another member to enjoy the experience. If this notice is not possible, they should message the DM as soon as possible with a brief explanation.  Real life can of course get in the way, but there is an expectation for all members to treat their DMs with respect wherever possible. DMs may report no-shows / no-contact to a Moderator.  Resident DMs will report all such instances 24 hours after game time.  The server operates a 3 strike policy for unexplained no-shows.  Strikes last for a year, are recorded, and are visible to server Staff and Resident DMs.  A third strike will result in a ban from signing up to Resident DM games.",
      "Members can appeal any disciplinary action to the Head Moderator. In exceptional circumstances or if there is a conflict of interest, the Head Moderator may pass on an appeal to the Admin. The result of this appeal will be delivered privately on Discord and will be a final decision.",
